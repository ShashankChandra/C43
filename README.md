pc/npc: The pc is your spaceship which you are controlling, the npc's are the moving lasers and rocks.
rules: There is a border to stop your spaceship from going out of bounds, if you are hit by a laser or rock 3 times, you start all over again, at a certain part of the map there is a end point which ends the game if you touch it, the more you move your spaceship, the more fuel you use, and so you have to grab fuel that is throughout the field to help you get through, you can collect bullets to destroy rocks, and you can collect a shield which can withstand a rock/laser only once. 
story: You are traveling in a spaceship when you come across a space field with moving lasers. Your job is to make it past that field without getting hit by the lasers or rocks.
rules to make fair: Bullets, shield
adaptivity: Decrease amount of bullets/shields, increase amount of rocks and lasers, increase amount of fuel lost, make shields and rocks move faster
goal of the game: Make it to the other side of the space field without destroying your ship
chance vs skill: The chance is how many bullets/shields spawn and how many lasers and rocks spawn, skill is how you are going to use the bullets/shields to get through the field and how well you can dodge the rocks and lasers
feedback: Amount of fuel left, amount of shields, amount of lives, amount of bullets, score(how far you have gotten + highscore)
